# signal-wordle-bot

Play wordle in Signal. Written in TypeScript and powered by [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli).

Special thanks to [TapuCosmo/signal-bot](https://github.com/TapuCosmo/signal-bot) and [How to make a Signal bot in Python](https://fabiobarbero.eu/posts/signalbot/), both of which I used as references when developing this project.
